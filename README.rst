Django Generic Bookmarks
========================

This application provides bookmark functionality to a Django project.

You can allow users to bookmark Django objects and then retreive them
in order, for instance, to display user's favourited items, send
notifications, customize the site behaviour.

You can handle different types of bookmarks for each content type
without adding additional fields to your models.

This app provides *jQuery* based widgets, useful for increasing the user 
experience (e.g.: ajax markers).

The source code for this app is hosted on 
https://bitbucket.org/frankban/django-generic-bookmarks/src

**Documentation** is avaliable 
`online <http://django-generic-bookmarks.readthedocs.org/>`_ 
and in the docs directory of the project.
